# Logistic-Regression-WDBC-Dataset
One of the most common classification algorithm is regression. Regression can be linear or multivariate depending on the number of features available. Regression maps the input vector to an output using a polynomial or basis function. Logistic regression is useful in determining the class to which the input vector belongs. It is called binary logistic regression when the number of classes is dichotomous(binary). In this project binary logistic regression algorithm is employed to determine the malignancy status of the patients in the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.
